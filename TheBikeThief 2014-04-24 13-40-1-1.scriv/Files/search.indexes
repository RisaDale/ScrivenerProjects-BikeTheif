            <Text>Rando the two wheeled larcenist Steals a bike and intoduces himself to us 
Exposition and defines as a mystical thing /Portland as character?


once- just once mind you. Not twice or three times. Just the once. At this time. And at no other. 
 
There was a bike thief named Rando

He stole all that was precious to the heart of man. 

He slept under the overpass, beating his weathered gaze all the way up the concrete turrets  iit every night  by the headlights of those on their way to things he had no experience with.

Watching those who wandered round him like endless small ants- unloved and untested , they ran in ugly circles, wishing for some sign that any of this was worth it.

He proved to them they did care by using the cover of night over his long greyed head 
to take their chariots


Easily tho- he gentled the locks and finessed the frame. Confident as a courtesan,
his strong, gnarled hands touched their love , stealing the known away with fingers so ligth they flew. 


Nimbly, they left the safe house of the in love and hurried off into the night, tucked between his oaken thighs that plowed through the clouds of steamy fog that enveloped the city. 

He reached his tent, tucked under the overpass. Neatly squared it held all he needed. This bike was so light he could heft it in with one hand. After putting it in the back he looked about for his own safety. 

Honor was not among thieves anymore

            <Text>Description of how he got this way, his motivations 


John Quincy Madison Zephyr Ellenbogen the Zth was a man who lied. He did it on Saturdays. On the 12th night. On the last day of work. When there was nothing to be won or lost, JQ would  fabricate, prevaricate, extrapolate and fornicate the truth so far up the bum that it could not be discerned even with an electron microscope. Of course, he would also do it when there were things to be  gotten down from the three ball shelf in the great carnival that we mention as life. 

He had been communicating in this way for so long he was incapable of the truth. 


How JQ Got here - Origin 


Why did this scion of an insaely wealthy family use the trusth as toilet paper? What was it abotu the cold bare facts that incensed him so, that made him unable to argue without citig false surveys and debating with people by using words that were in no dittionary? The problem here was that when he was a child, even when he told the truth he was not beleived. His wealthy , beautoiful parents were less than inpressed by the rounded ball of a chiled that had spat from their loins. Beleiveng him to be a trhowback to their earthier ancestors. and his father suspected that he was a not his anywa (a misconception, but his mother had been boinking the chaffeur around teh time taht he was conceived. Not that his father cared so much, as he had married his wife as a concession to his parents. 


As his father Juliiao Ignatiusa the Yth was on his 7th marriage at the time, he no longer beleived in what love looked like, and settled quite happily for corn dogs and the occcasional raiders game. He would ask his currrent brde, one Alphesa Ellenbgen, nee SwainFeller to wear a raiders jersey and a pair of big black boots, stommping about the great room with  great alacrity and and even greater silver platter of pizza corn dogs, not from the kosher butcher.Given this , while they mated with great vigor on occassion due to their overload of carbs and the excitememtn of the winnings of the men in spandex, it was without any actual conversation. They knew that they existed in the house, but rarely if ever actually spoke to one another when in the house. 


So when the zygote was pierced during (inzert game time) the play that (insert famous football player) , it was with indifference and some minor  explosions. Julao put it down to gas, and Alphesa had long since ceased to expect her rumble in the jungle. 

So it was with great surprise that with rthe coming of baseball season she found herself with child, encciente, bun in the over, great, puffy with promise and enlarged with  a bumpkin. 

Julao was not overly concerned. All that money resulted in a sofetneing of any shocking knews with cusions of wads of cash tossed at it . And the house, which occuped one entire park block in Downtown Portland was large enough that he could successfully avoid bothmother and child until at least kindergarten, which he proceeded to do. 

Alphesa took slighly more interest, but not by much. Her chaffeuur had the abilitty to both find and manipulate her clitoral region with an impressive ability generally only found n the sex addict or the person who is geenuinely in love with smeone who is not in love with them back. 

This kept her oocupped even during the pregance , up to the mmoemnt when the    contratcions started. JQ was only a a few hours behinfg the last bout of lovemacking, and so his exit was greased by excessive amounts of foreign jizz. HIs mother did think that may have had something to do with his lifelong expressionn f just having drank something made of lemon and bitters, even as he popped out og the womb. He also looked somewhat like somene whoucfl have handed him a cigar, or pergaps a pipe after he made his arrival. His father was in Gsataad. Then again, all wealthy fathers made it a point to be in Gstaad at that ttime, and therefore he had plenty of people to share the imported cuban cigars handroled by Castro's bastard children 


So after a lifetime of Daddy in gstaad and mummy almots nonexistent, he had learned that the ability to connect with the rest f the world was greatly limited by the lack of communications he'd had. When he entered third grade after being home schooled, he spoke a form of ersatz italian, so as to avoid actually speaking with the children around him that seemed to know each otheer. This became his mode e=of engagement and eventually became a mania- teh desire to warp reality so that it looked best on him was pathological, making him use the blow torch of lies on the butter of the innocent with such regularity that even those who knew how he operated trembled when he looked upon them, for fear he would smashe theor perfectly healthy and well beheved reputations like a heavy milk bottle against cobblestones. 

So being the child of the wealthy gave him much tme to kill. They had both eventually passed in the inevitable high powered vehicle accident, him on motorized snowboard, her on a mechanical bull in the Memphis locarion of Dave and busters.

Wordss that he makes up 
Using them in conversation
Timeing 
Insulting people with does he know he’s lying? 





Scorning any capability of their only offspring to be practical, they had left the fortune in trust for the rest of his life, ot be doled out in dollops so large it would take most of a small nation of at least a million to spend it all. He did manage to evince a lifelng hatred of dogs, primarily because they could never question his lies and but would also know that he was full of shit. Given that the only job he had for rthe Ellenbogen familyw was to appear as an ambassador for crunchettes , a type of dog food sold in all conveniece stores in every single place in the entire world. It was made of shredded waste from all tyes of industrical agriculture. While it wasn't great for dogs, ita lso wasn't the worst thing you could feed them when it was 12 degrees out and the walk to the store was the only option when the car died. Hence the millions and millions of dollars. 

Of course, the ellenbogen fortune was made of many other things, but this was the one that he had been put in charge of. He was, as they say, mostly harmless because of his percied nd real stupidity. So after many many years of being forced to go to dog shows where all kinds of cana slobbered on him, he truly hated them with a passion that knew almost no bounds. 

So he plotted. He sat in the top window of the Park Block mansion watching the lessers wander by. Them with their true lives lived in the real and imagined past. Them in their coupled and friended lives, connected to each other and actually listening to one another. Hmph he said- hmph. How could he hurt them if they did not listen to him? He had a lifetime of anger stored up at his pressed against the window world. Just because he lied didn't mean he didn't want some of them to be true. 

His favorite lie to tell was about how loved he was by all who encountered him. He only told that one to himself, as that was the one who cared abut that one. When he explained to all others that he was a fabulosus and interesting human being, accpted in all the best clubs, adored by Selena and Christia fans aloke, a trused by baboes and onsters- well that wasn't so true But one day he decided that he was going to make it that way. That was the day that he decided to murder history. 

In all it’s exactitude. In all it’s glory In every single way, he was going to make it go away and be re-written by the likes of him. 

SInce his band of sycophants left him at the process moment when the loneliness and sobriety struck, he took the crossing of that those moments to be he ancient and pre- selected reality. Yes, it was then that he decided to form an unholy alliance with the Philosoraptor, whose services could be purchased for a price. 

He picked up his divice, a thin palladium encased phone with a sensor that when you passed the  correct hand over it it spawned a two d  visual of the being you were speaking to. 

Given that the being was Yumanity, who lived above the treelike and communicated via alpha wave , it was wise of him to stick with two d. The third d would enable even a smaller version of him would undoubtedly destroy the carpet in the boardroom. 
(Break and intro Rando and  the Ice queen?) 
***********************************
Even the 2D Yumanity was a bit disturbing. Several jeweled horns stuck out at angles that made no sense for a more symmetrical being. His lazy eye and his hard working one competed for space on a face that looked creepy crawly con trolly at best, the emergence of the death. 


“You rang, oh deep pocketed one? “ Yumanity drawled in his best imitation of deep south .

“Why yes, ahem errr- I  have a job for you” 

“Will you ever just invite me to tea? “ 
JMQ was startled by this plaint- he took it more seriously than it was worth. 

“Oh er em - I didn’t know you liked tea “

Yumanity threw his head back and laughed heartily at JMQ’ expense. 

“Tea with the likes of you is perhaps not the best thing to do- but perhaps not the worst”

He suddenly appeared in the boardroom albeit in a slightly smaller form than usual . At 1/3 his general size he was still enormous. 

“WHere is my lapsing souhng? 
JMQ struck a bell with a gong- a small man wearing a suit of mail entered, bearing a silver salver with the implements of tea upon it. After depositing it on the boardroom table it moonwalked out, showing no other signs that it had noted the beast that took up 3/4 of the room. While it was hard to get good help these days, it was easy when you paid triple for it. 

“Let me guess- you want to kill all and sundry again. It seems to be what you try to do every year. “

“I feel it is time to kill history and replace it with memory” 

Yumanity threw back his head and laughed- “That is easy- I already did it for you….”

JMQ shook his head- “She is back, the Ice Queen. She is trying to drag the Reality Kings back in - you know what will happen then, 

Yumanity sighed, disgusted. 

“You've done it this time haven't you?”

JMQ sniffed. His verbal acuity should not be challenged by this yeti monster, this arrogant beast of will. 


"I suppose you had a better idea, just murdering history willy nilly, yet not truly finishing the job and leaving her to roam unfettered?" 


Yumanity was disgusted with the truth of this matter- So he doubled down and sent small puffs of smoke out of his antlers and through his nose. Noisome did not even begin to cover it. The boardroom now was filled with a low level smoke cloud that outdid sulfur and a post world series dumpster for stench. 



He laughed a bit " What ever shall we do? Destroying the past seems like a thing that should be relatively easy- the question is which parts of it are we going to decimate? Shall we scrunch it into small bits like spitballs? Shall we eat it live and whole , still wriggling from the tank? Shall we just feed it to the pike that lives at the mouth of the Willamette? "

JMQ walked the geometric pattern of the rug- one foot in front of the other, he concentrated on seeing it so hard that it dissolved at the end of his nose. 

I suppose if we are to murder the past we should choose a specific part- that seems to be a bit easier than

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File > Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. The necessary settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle e-book.

How To Use This Template
	•	Create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel. For instance, Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being’s first part is entitled “PART ONE: Lightness and Weight”. In that example, you would name the part, “Lightness and Weight” (the “Part One” will be added during Compile). You can choose not to include these titles during the Compile process.
	•	Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) Some chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	•	Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
	•	Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents > Change Icon feature.)
	•	Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do - you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template > Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way. Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.

Compiling
	•	Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Research” folders). You will choose different front matter depending on the format to which you are compiling.
	•	Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to follow the instructions below when you want to compile to a different format. After that, you can just go to File > Compile… and click the “Compile” button straight away.
	•	Note that if you cannot find any of the presets mentioned below in the “Format As” menu in the Compile panel, please select “Manage Compile Format Presets…” from the bottom of the “Format As” menu. This will bring up a panel that allows you to add more formats to the menu.
	•	Tip: You can open this document in a QuickReference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.

		To compile to standard manuscript format:
	◦	Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (note that it will have been filled in by default with information from Address Book).
	◦	Go to File > Compile…
	◦	Select “Standard Manuscript Format (with Parts)” from the “Format As” pop-up button if it is not already selected. (If “Novel (with Parts)” is selected, that’s fine too - that’s just the default format for this particular template, which is the same as standard manuscript format.)
	◦	Ensure that the “Summary” tab is selected at the top of the Compile panel. (This isn’t strictly necessary—the below options can also be found in the “Contents” pane of the “All Options” tab.)
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “Manuscript Format” folder from the pop-up button next to it (this is already selected by default).
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

		To compile to paperback PDF format:
	◦	Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback Novel folder.
	◦	Go to File > Compile…
	◦	Select “Paperback Novel (with Parts)” from the “Format As” pop-up button if it is not already selected.
	◦	Ensure that the “Summary” tab is selected at the top of the Compile panel. (This isn’t strictly necessary—the below options can also be found in the “Contents” pane of the “All Options” tab.)
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “Paperback Novel” folder from the pop-up button next to it if it is not already selected.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

		To compile to e-book format:
	◦	Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/E-Book folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
	◦	Import a cover image (the recommended size is 600x800 pixels, preferably in JPG or PNG format). You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “E-Book” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided - you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
	◦	Go to File > Compile…
	◦	Select “E-book (with Parts)” from the “Format As” pop-up button if it is not already selected.
	◦	Ensure that the “Summary” tab is selected at the top of the Compile panel. (This isn’t strictly necessary—the below options can also be found in the “Contents”, “Cover” and “Layout” panes of the “All Options” tab.)
	◦	If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “E-Book” folder from the pop-up button next to it if it is not already selected. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
	◦	If you have imported your own cover image, be sure to select it from the “Cover image” pop-up button.
	◦	If you don’t want an HTML table of contents included, un-tick “Generate HTML table of contents”. This must be ticked when exporting to Kindle format but is less necessary when exporting to EPUB format, because most EPUB readers generate their own table of contents anyway.
	◦	From the “Compile for” pop-up button, choose whether to export to EPUB or Kindle format.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
	•	Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customised by going to Project > Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
	•	Part subtitles: If you don’t want to include the titles of your “Part” folders in your compiled manuscript, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile sheet and deselect “Title” for the “Level 1” folder item. Then click on “Section Layout…” and remove the colon and space at the end of the title prefix (“Part &lt;$t:part>”).
	•	Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile sheet and deselect “Title” for the “Level 2+” folder item and the “Level 1” and “Level 2” text items. (Conversely, if you do want to include chapter titles for formats that don’t include them by default, tick these items.)
	•	Page header and footer: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile sheet (under “All Options”).
	•	Page size: The “Paperback Novel (with Parts)” format is set to export to a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with CreateSpace. You can customise this by clicking on the “Page Setup…” button in the “Page Settings” pane of Compile.
	•	Font: You can use “Quick Font Override” in Compile to change the font used throughout the final document (this is available from both the “Summary” and “All Options” tabs). Note that fonts are not included in e-books, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a particular font in an e-book).
	•	Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
	1.	To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents > Change Icon to choose a different icon.
	2.	To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
	3.	To set things up so that when the special folder created in (1) is selected and you hit “Add”, a new document based on the one you set up in (2) is created, select the folder and go to Documents > Default New Subdocument Type and select the special template document you created.
	•	Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
	1.	Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are contained directly inside the “Part” folders (that is, at the same level as the current “Chapter” folders).
	2.	Move the chapter folders to the Trash.
	3.	Create a new text document for each chapter.
	4.	In the “Separators” pane of the Compile sheet, change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.
	5.	If your scene separators are centred (for instance if you are using “#” as the scene separator) and you want them to appear centred in the compiled document, too, choose the “Formatting” pane of Compile, click on “Options…” and tick “Preserve alignment” and “Centered text only”.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Standard Manuscript Format (with Parts)”; “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback Novel (with Parts)” format; and “iBooks E-book” shows the results when compiling to “E-book (with Parts)” format and opening the resulting EPUB file in iBooks on the iPad.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File > Save As Template.</Text>

            <Text>Rando and the Ice Queen 

I have no history, she said. None whatever. There is no long thin line of remembrance and regret that ties me to the earth.

He leaned back against the tombstone n the garden of death. It was a cemetery situated at the top of Skyline, looking over the city. The rolling hills sloped sharply off to one side, giving the dearly departed a cinematic view of the bridges and houses that lay beneath the fog blanket,  like  the legs of the duck, serene on top and whirling madly underneath

The girl wasn’t really a girl- she was one of those  beings  with lines that mapped every place she had been at the corners of her mouth and eyes, the two things that got the most use. She was lovely nonetheless, her silver-gray hair slipping gently into the crook of her collarbone as if suggesting that his hand may trail after, feeling the skin that had not seen summers and the hair that was spun like the silk of spiders. 

Rando wanted very much to kiss her. He felt that might give her something to remember, even if it was only surprise and shock that such a man would take a liberty. 

“How do you tie your shoes or get to the bottom of the ocean? “

She meditated on that question, cocking her head with a look of general anesthesia just shaken off. “I have not needed to tie my shoes in a while as she pushed her feet out from under her flowing peacock gown. They were long and thin and white, consistent with the rest of her. The thing that was a bit surprising were the prehensile toes, shaped with icicle nails that sparkled in the weak reflection of sun that broke through the grey fog that lay uncorking and disinterested at the feat of the garden. 

They wiggled at him, momentarily distracting him from his purpose in finding out what this being wanted of him.  

His blonde grey  curls caught the light that always sat on death’s garden. He came up here every so often to commune with nature, outside the Urban Growth Boundary- the UGB was a both a prison and a protection, a spot where the world both started and ended at the horizon. 

This place did not grow death- it maintained it, keeping souls gently.


The pickpocketeers gravestone was where he come, to mourn his fallen colleagues . Manju, Jerome and Isolde lay not under these solid marble statues, but in the belly of an air whale , It had eaten them during a particularly wild jousting party that was held underneath the bridge where Rando lived, the air Whales 



He reached out a hand to touch her - his hands were  filled with interesting callouses and smart fingers. She sighed as though he had already stroked her.



History, she said. That word has a lot of things  it means he said. 

“Well”- she used the moss of the gravestone of M.Bartlett, 1867-1902 to cushion her back as she sat up and looked him in the eye- “history is one of those things that is written and re-written -

and if you are going to change history of course it would be to suit yourself .....you'd be foolish to do otherwise” 

“Hmph” he said. 
“Hmph “ she said back, face smiling and one eyebrow raised. 


Once that long thin line has been broken there is little to say. Or perhaps that is when things actually start getting interesting. 


He thought about telling her more- but she grabbed his hair and kissed him. It seared. It left him breathless within breaths. There was a  mark involved. 

His arms pulled her in, and hers pulled back.

This is the moment tat she starts to understand the role of the crazy making that John Z Ellenbogen is putting down. She at first has some problems getting people to believe her, but her Piratography skills help her to convince people and get them to support her 


They came down the stairs to look at the new world that just augmented the old one. 

It as not what was expected. Shocker. 

The priuses and bikes now shared the road with  horse drawn carts and wagons with wheels that usually were only used as chandeliers in the mid range steak houses. Their iron casings rang on the cobbles, causing the usual city music to be a cacophony that had minor and major wind chime notes going through it.

No one seemed to notice. There was no confusion on the faces of the people s they continues through their day. There were still bikes of shiny metal next to pennyfarthjings and bikes that looked as though they had been built by some Mad Maxmillian , throwing showers of sparks as they went about their day. 


Lea and Ben looked at each other, and and shrugged, 

Ben said "Well, at least we get to keep the cars.  Half of SW is gone tho. "

Lea looked up and the huge pink skyscraper that tended to house the Ellenbogen space was replaced by an ornate victorian that covered the same footage, but more closely resembled the Addams family house in a shade of shocking pink that would make Danielle Steele blush. The gables and the fretwork were a deep purple that thrw the blush of it into sharp relief. The windows were all open, and a sound she could not quite identify issued from behind the wavery lace curtains. 

Since she had a meeting with Mr. E at 2 there, she decided that the only way this was going to be viable was to accept this as bizarre and continue forward 
Ben came to the same conclusion, as he was a pragmatist- it was what bonded the two of them most closely, their view of the world as something to be dealt with as it was, not as they wished it would be. 


They went upstairs, finished their coffee and checked to see if their were still phone use. There was, and they kissed goodbye and went their separate ways, planning to meet later and discuss what happened during the day. 

Lea had put her Piratologist outfit on- it consisted of a pith helmet and suit that would bot have been out of place in the deepest jungles of Africa, circa 1890. Given the changes of today, she figured this might actually be a better thng. SOmetimes her piratology was regarded as quack science, especially by the ducks, Her view was that everything old is new again, so she basically went back through history to utilize what happened in the past 200 years to solve the problems of today 

Piratology for the cause of urban renewal swashbuckled it's ay through the world. It looked at the problems of homelessness, hunger, social justice and theft as the normal outgrowth of a nuturing society. Since these problems were complex and fraught with confusing, Piratical practitioners used swords, cannons and the occassional plank to get get the world to step to the proper tune. 

Mr Ellenbogen was a target for this- his lack of care for the health of the planet was problematic because there was nothing that stopped people from polluting things, and destroying the earth around them with their crap. Tossing shit into a dumpster, and then dumping it somewhere close to where people lived was acceptable somehow. 

She had become a Piratologist because she was tired of watching teh world her children would live in slowly degenerate. She knew that the only way to fix the future as to go past the past, and change the way that things worked. This was no mean feat, give the amount of terrible things that the corporations were willing to do in the service of the almighty dollar. </Text>

n existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.[5] Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.[</Text>

Following Ben down the path. Again.  Been doing it since I was 5.To be fair, he also followed me about the same amount. The 

He looked back at me, smiling his gap toothed grin and said just before his bald head dissappeared down the black hole " One does not need to put a hand on the stove to know that fire burns" .

  The middle of my left foot welcomed the feeling of  the third down rung. The rust encrusted sewer cap sat at a slight angle far enough away from the hole that it couldn't possibly accidentally end up sealing us in by mistake.

The sound of voices echoing and re- echoing off the wall made the three foot across  pipe even more claustrophobic.Now that I couldn't see my feet they  occupied another world somewhere, unattached to my legs yet carrying me along.The rest of me felt elongated .


The clang of Ben's boots on the ladder confirmed I was going in the right direction, so I soldiered on.

Once we cleared the edge of the tunnel I could feel the wind blowing between my legs. There was a 5 foot drop to a 2 foot wide stream, or the rest of the ladder that curved along the wall. My shoulders yearned towards the wall and I shook the rest of the way down off as my feet landed in a shallow puddle


A faint phosphorescence lit up the chamber, showing me where Ben was standing.He had one eyebrow so high it practically rucked his entire face 

Lined up against the far wall were 7 men in tasteful suits and red ties. They seemed to be led by an orange hued man who was spouting invective at them.

" Women, vote , teaparty teaparty, GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN....."


They grunted at him as one, one hand placed on the shoulder of the man next to him. There was a zealot's light in their eyes, burning holes in the being in front of them who continued to babble nonsense.

            <Synopsis>300 questions of PARLIAMENTARIAN</Synopsis>
            <Text>

The philosoraptor was made a million so old things that no one could quite see what they did. Taken together, there was a brilliant flash of light and sparkle that would blow the hair back of any who saw it The feeling would blow through the hair and make you feel as though 7 thousand whispering anchors were pulling the bottom of the channel, digging a deeper and deeper trench until the center of the earth was reached, and all was laid bare

 In the center of the mountain there was a glacier that had slipped under the roots of it when the earth was young and fiesty 
Back then, Mountains were more like trees- they shifted with the ground and had tentacular feet that were made of igneous and sedimentary rock 
the amount of sun on their north face determined where they went- sometimes to the east, sometimes the north. 

In any case, this particular dragon had fallen asleep  in a ditch and the mountain heaved herself down, sitting for a moment to look up at the gibbous moon


It was warm and safe under there, so the dragon turned over and slept for 346 years
When he awoke, he could only see the thinnest sliver of moon through the volcanic crown. He knew it was time for him to soar above with the other flying creatures of the night



Shaking the shards of ice off his great  purple, orange  and green scaled wings, he realized how limiting the mountain had been. Safe, and protective, but looking up at that thin slit of night he felt that pull of wild adventure- his dancy and romancy heart swelled to feel the dark air on his ears and through his teeth, drying his great dragon eyes as he  sped through the cold night air 


And the sound- of the air whales and the battypusses, the monkachunks and the belivarians- he stretched , and slithered through the crack . For dragons are endlesslesly mutable 
He arrived in the air with alacrity and charm, the rest of the night creatures calling to him. They flew in noisy and loving formation toward the snow- for there was  war that called



Being alive leaves a mark or two. Being suddenly separated from that state leaves it as well. The philosoaptior knew this, and spent a large amount of time being ever so bored with the status quo





THE PHILOSORAPTOR, HAVING SPENT THREE HUNDRED AND fort six indvidual years inside a mountain had pondered on teh probelm of common sense quite a bit. S/he (since s/he was the only one of it's kind) had eaten an entire library before settling down for shis long long long nap. The inside of the mounatin was a place where only the deepest thoughts and the most molecular of knowledge wsa to be had. The mountain was one of those places covered in a frosting of delcious sugary goodness, the cocaine piles of snow warming the earth until the sun returned from it's vacation on the other side of the world. 


The mountain itself was an icubator, a fortress and a haven. The Philosoraptor had actually eaten a few philosophers as well in the haste to ingest all that information. Philosophers are not known for being too fast on thie r feet and they had been hidden in the stacks perusing the ideas of dead people so well it was kind of like eating too much trail mix at one gulp and discovering that somemoen had hidden the beef jerkey in there. 


So for each of the three hundred and forty six years she had pondered a new question. The questions were :

Who really killed JR?
Why do you need opposite warp and woof?
Did you fart? 
How was this all gong to turn out? 
Should she allow this to happen? 

What about the children? 
How about the monstrous monstrosities of monkeydom? 
What about the burling borlingum of baronets?

Damnatio memoriae is the Latin phrase literally meaning "condemnation of memory" in the sense of a judgment that a person must not be remembered. It was a form of dishonor that could be passed by the Roman Senate upon traitors or others who brought discredit to the Roman State. The intent was to erase someone from history, a task somewhat easier in ancient times, when documentation was much sparser.

She was not to be rememberd. She was to be stricken from every stone, every molecule of ice , every shivery mated hand that had touched hers- she would no longer be in that space. Her  atoms and ions and electrons would be excised from their chains, leaving ammonia where fresh air had been, poison where medicine had existed. 
Expulsion would result in a being not formed- the collective djini would no longer scent of her essence- it would;t sound like the crystal ring of her voice- it would only hold the negative space, the not therenesss



He was to expunged. Deleted. Sent to Coventry, Not even worth derision, his treason was so great that he was not to be borne 

To expel from memory- 


We will excise her from all memorials. She will not be allowed to be seen by anyone, ever again. Her mind will be sent to a place where it will live inside a glass jar , faceted against clarity- the idea of selves will be eradicated. This is when and where I get to take ove rthe minds of those around me, and kill the memory of the things that came before. All the embarassment and fear that used to attend even my simplest actions will be destroyed and sent off to the hell caverns. The young lovers will be in charge of it. 


The young lovers stared down the center of the cavern. they had thought that they had reached the bottom evidently the bottom was not the bottom, but rather the beginning of the bottom. It would pull futher and and further down until thre was nothing to be seen out there. There was a huge machine, made of bicycles. It had derailleures for gears and wheeels within wheels and further and further down it showed an intricate series of gargoyled carvings that piled on top of one another they were the carvings (call them by the isrish name ) that spoke - they had holes drilled in them strategically so that when the underground wind current came through they sange and sent ball bearngs sliding through the hills and dales of the tubes. The ball bearings would jangle in the metal tubes causing a clatter that covered the sound of the air - there wre 10 tubes that rose from the ditch that surrounded the great brass and wheeled mostrosity, and there didn;t seem to be an off or on switch to it. The sound and motion of the world appeared to be what made it move. 



Leah and ben looked at one another , puzzled as to what to do next. They had been sent here by the Common Ground to find out where all the common sense was getting off to. It kept dissappearing- one minute peope would be dong perfectly reasonable things and the next they would be jumping off of things, running inot walls , selling high and buying low, penguins and pollywogs and platypi mating. It could go horribly wrong- or it could go horribly right. Mor eoften it was wrong. and so the community had decided to find people who would

This is about history and memory. 


She wanted to explain to him what memory was- so she did 
IQ said to hhim 

"Memory is the way that we sugar coat things. Its the little white sugar pills, the softened butter glaze and the idea that the past is immutable. It is none of these things. "

Yumanity looked at her, wondering where she was going with all this as he was itching to get back to destroying the world. After all the world was not nearly as fun when it was in stasis.

Rando And Death and the loss of the Philipino Midget Twins 

Rando had never cared about death before. It was a thing that would happen eventually, and that allowed him to wander in and out of the caverns and tunnels and down the streets of the city with so little fear as to seem otherworldly - he did not jump at loud noises and blinked nary an eye at the huge bus that bore down upon his plastic encased ass he know that he was going to part company with the world at some pojnt. 

His trail inside that time had been dictated by a true lack of empathy for his fellow man. He could not see where it would behoove him to be a part of this hunting and gathering, this pulling of wagons into circles, this endless desire to be in the same places at the same time on any given day. His need for a free life shucked of artifice or pretences outweighed all the other pyramids of needs heaped up by the experts whose names he distrusted .

He started to care about death when it came from the side that he wasn't looking for- when he shared food and flame with the pickpocketeers, they had grown dear to him. 

Isolde and Manju were a pair of phillipino dwarves that sated themselves on the pickings outside of the institutions of the city. The churches and cemeteries, the high end restaurant  the strip bars and the dance clubs- they stayed just outside of these places as people with pockets would wander into them and they being at pocket height would acquire wallets and phones, lipstick and keys, a rat, a silvery contraption that seemed to look like something taht would change the course of your teeth. All these things were piled high in thejr underramp nest, the magpie in them unable to part with treasures that had no value as long as they sparkled. These were all that was left of them after the air whale consumed them . 

Altho, Rando to be fair thought that anything directed at hime was being prejudicial after all. and the loss of Manju and Isolde meant that there was no flame to share- a single light against the night was sufficient to hold most of it back, but not to eradicate the half formed monsters that lay just outside it's circle, their phantom limbs passing through the flicker and reaching for him when silence became too loud

Thus he wanted to replace them- to find another being to share the flames and the small words . Replacement sounded so - cold . After being alone for 200 years - it left a gap where there had been no space before. Someone to be part of the next chapter. 

So he decided to ride the buddhist bike- the lack of attachment to outcome seemed like a good way to approach this. 
The bike was long and lean and hugged the curb as though it had grown there. The floweres threaded through it's spokes were unrra as was the shade of bright vermillion it was enamelled with. It stood high and proud next to the curb, a helmet hanging off the left handle bar. The locks that secured it to the fence werre intricate- made of iridescent clam shells they winked at him in complicity, knowing they weere going for a ride. A short ride to the next incarnation, but since the bike was buddhist it cared not all of such things 


To disconnect from the outcome- to see so far down the well that it seems to circle all the way through the molten core of the world out the other side, through the atmosphere to the endless silently humming stars to end up at the back of the head that started the circle, watching from over the shoulder, knowing that the sounds it heard were only the beating of the blood in the veins that tied the body together. 

That was whagtt could save the biker the knowledge that they could mount up an where they ended up was of little to no imprtantce. Hence the need to ride with the world at bay 

The Celestial buddha was what powered the bike- the self reliance and self power - and the fact that nothing ultimately has existence- crossed over to the rubber and metal.</Text>

Did you have any common sense she asked? 

The arching of the eybrows told her that was probably not the right question so she tried again 

"Do you know how to tie your shoes or take notes at class"

The eyebrows were now doing forward rolls, sidewase rollls and and butter rolls, implying that the person asking the question had indded lost their ability to have any common sense 

In it’s most basic incurnation, common sense should be a reduction of all your experiences to the place where it makes Good Judgements Finding ones good judgment inside your head while being tormented by EatAnters and Biosopholucids was the challenge of living inside the UGB- once the UGB had encircled you you wed sure to lose your ability to be both historical and intellectual simultaneously. It seems that this had crept in slowy but surely, taking away the self preservatives, enticing people to do the stupidest of things. It sent them up the mountain without a compass, it made them choose people to live with who never did a dish, it cause dthe great Clown and Country debacle, complete with bundled arcs of demonic possiions that used them up so quickly that the .

Common sense by it’s very definition was there to preserve the species. It was the distillation of all the things that came into your sesnse. The more you used this judgement, the more it became useful. It was what made the perpetual Good Sense machine continue to thrive in the cavern, as there were no other ways to keep moving in a world that relied on fear and emotion to to cater to its whims. 

This had caused some very ugly things in the space time continuum.

            <Text>She knew even before it happened that it was gong to happen. It was the miserable hell that was being the past, the present and the future simultaneously- when you know all that, it is hard to get out of your own way, especially as the future barreled down at you at an alarming rate. 

She stood atop the Philosoraptors mountain, waiting for her lover to claim her life. The chinook wailed violently, sounding the the sorrows of the ice clad trees like some maniacal wind chime . She was wrapped in a warm thin garment made of the cobwebs of the thousand year spiders. They had clothed the past for as long as any could remember, spinning their almost invisible threads with clock tick precision. No one remembered when they did- they just started and continued, no end to their world. 


Yumanity crunched down from above the treeline, the snowy sift of the mountain occasionally sighing under the mastery of his size 56 boots. Made of the skin of lost souls, they howled with every step, signaling her impending end. 


She had seen this day in her waking hours, knowing that his hands that once caressed her would now close around her throat/ 

“You are here “ he said in surprise. 

“Why wouldn’t I be? “ 
“I am here to kill you”
“I know- it is necessary”

What Yumanity did not know, as he did not come equipped with the same ideas of backwards, forwards and around wards that she did was that his actions were fortold- he had fooled himself into thinking that free will actually existed, that he was not a product of his nurture after all. He would soon find out that was not the case. 

He stood in front of her, all the horns and tentacles that swirled around his head in halo formation suddenly limp and unhappy, not as a monster who was here to kill, but as a being who would be saying farewell to someone he loved. 

Her compassion for him rose , and she offered him her white neck. Wordlessly he placed his thorny fingers round it, squeezing until her eyes looked frantic with a lack of breath, and then slowy, slowly , the life force oozed out of them, leaving the shell behind. 

He looked down at his hands and saw the shell of her . He shrugged and tossed it over one shoulder as though it no longer existed, which it didn’t . Turning his back to the wind, he started back up the mountain to the treelike. The body rolled down the hill, gathering mosses and sticks and even more icicles than she came by naturally. It occasionally stuck to trees or rocks ,sometimes for a minute, sometimes for longer. There was no time anymore, now that the past was dead. This made for some comeplicated re arrangements down in the valley.

            <Text>Since he did not know of her before the meeting on top of the grave, her appearance in his dreams frightened him- her brown, sad eyes, the lashes tipped with frost and the fluffing of the air around him.

He had watched the sparkling rockfall , completely shot trough with pyritical veins slide down the mountain. </Text>

            <Synopsis>Introduction of the Bad guy

His origin story</Synopsis>
            <Text>John Quincy Madison Zephyr Ellenbogen the Zth was a man who lied. He did it on Saturdays. On the 12th night. On the last day of work. When there was nothing to be won or lost, JQ would  fabricate, prevaricate, extrapolate and fornicate the truth so far up the bum that it could not be discerned even with an electron microscope. Of course, he would also do it when there were things to be  gotten down from the three ball shelf in the great carnival that we mention as life. 

He had been communicating in this way for so long he was incapable of the truth. 


How JQ Got here - Origin 


Why did this scion of an insaely wealthy family use the trusth as toilet paper? What was it abotu the cold bare facts that incensed him so, that made him unable to argue without citig false surveys and debating with people by using words that were in no dittionary? The problem here was that when he was a child, even when he told the truth he was not beleived. His wealthy , beautoiful parents were less than inpressed by the rounded ball of a chiled that had spat from their loins. Beleiveng him to be a trhowback to their earthier ancestors. and his father suspected that he was a not his anywa (a misconception, but his mother had been boinking the chaffeur around teh time taht he was conceived. Not that his father cared so much, as he had married his wife as a concession to his parents. 


As his father Juliiao Ignatiusa the Yth was on his 7th marriage at the time, he no longer beleived in what love looked like, and settled quite happily for corn dogs and the occcasional raiders game. He would ask his currrent brde, one Alphesa Ellenbgen, nee SwainFeller to wear a raiders jersey and a pair of big black boots, stommping about the great room with  great alacrity and and even greater silver platter of pizza corn dogs, not from the kosher butcher.Given this , while they mated with great vigor on occassion due to their overload of carbs and the excitememtn of the winnings of the men in spandex, it was without any actual conversation. They knew that they existed in the house, but rarely if ever actually spoke to one another when in the house. 


So when the zygote was pierced during (inzert game time) the play that (insert famous football player) , it was with indifference and some minor  explosions. Julao put it down to gas, and Alphesa had long since ceased to expect her rumble in the jungle. 

So it was with great surprise that with rthe coming of baseball season she found herself with child, encciente, bun in the over, great, puffy with promise and enlarged with  a bumpkin. 

Julao was not overly concerned. All that money resulted in a sofetneing of any shocking knews with cusions of wads of cash tossed at it . And the house, which occuped one entire park block in Downtown Portland was large enough that he could successfully avoid bothmother and child until at least kindergarten, which he proceeded to do. 

Alphesa took slighly more interest, but not by much. Her chaffeuur had the abilitty to both find and manipulate her clitoral region with an impressive ability generally only found n the sex addict or the person who is geenuinely in love with smeone who is not in love with them back. 

This kept her oocupped even during the pregance , up to the mmoemnt when the    contratcions started. JQ was only a a few hours behinfg the last bout of lovemacking, and so his exit was greased by excessive amounts of foreign jizz. HIs mother did think that may have had something to do with his lifelong expressionn f just having drank something made of lemon and bitters, even as he popped out og the womb. He also looked somewhat like somene whoucfl have handed him a cigar, or pergaps a pipe after he made his arrival. His father was in Gsataad. Then again, all wealthy fathers made it a point to be in Gstaad at that ttime, and therefore he had plenty of people to share the imported cuban cigars handroled by Castro's bastard children 


So after a lifetime of Daddy in gstaad and mummy almots nonexistent, he had learned that the ability to connect with the rest f the world was greatly limited by the lack of communications he'd had. When he entered third grade after being home schooled, he spoke a form of ersatz italian, so as to avoid actually speaking with the children around him that seemed to know each otheer. This became his mode e=of engagement and eventually became a mania- teh desire to warp reality so that it looked best on him was pathological, making him use the blow torch of lies on the butter of the innocent with such regularity that even those who knew how he operated trembled when he looked upon them, for fear he would smashe theor perfectly healthy and well beheved reputations like a heavy milk bottle against cobblestones. 

So being the child of the wealthy gave him much tme to kill. They had both eventually passed in the inevitable high powered vehicle accident, him on motorized snowboard, her on a mechanical bull in the Memphis locarion of Dave and busters.

Wordss that he makes up 
Using them in conversation
Timeing 
Insulting people with does he know he’s lying? 





Scorning any capability of their only offspring to be practical, they had left the fortune in trust for the rest of his life, ot be doled out in dollops so large it would take most of a small nation of at least a million to spend it all. He did manage to evince a lifelng hatred of dogs, primarily because they could never question his lies and but would also know that he was full of shit. Given that the only job he had for rthe Ellenbogen familyw was to appear as an ambassador for crunchettes , a type of dog food sold in all conveniece stores in every single place in the entire world. It was made of shredded waste from all tyes of industrical agriculture. While it wasn't great for dogs, ita lso wasn't the worst thing you could feed them when it was 12 degrees out and the walk to the store was the only option when the car died. Hence the millions and millions of dollars. 

Of course, the ellenbogen fortune was made of many other things, but this was the one that he had been put in charge of. He was, as they say, mostly harmless because of his percied nd real stupidity. So after many many years of being forced to go to dog shows where all kinds of cana slobbered on him, he truly hated them with a passion that knew almost no bounds. 

So he plotted. He sat in the top window of the Park Block mansion watching the lessers wander by. Them with their true lives lived in the real and imagined past. Them in their coupled and friended lives, connected to each other and actually listening to one another. Hmph he said- hmph. How could he hurt them if they did not listen to him? He had a lifetime of anger stored up at his pressed against the window world. Just because he lied didn't mean he didn't want some of them to be true. 

His favorite lie to tell was about how loved he was by all who encountered him. He only told that one to himself, as that was the one who cared abut that one. When he explained to all others that he was a fabulosus and interesting human being, accpted in all the best clubs, adored by Selena and Christia fans aloke, a trused by baboes and onsters- well that wasn't so true But one day he decided that he was going to make it that way. That was the day that he decided to murder history. 

In all it’s exactitude. In all it’s glory In every single way, he was going to make it go away and be re-written by the likes of him. 

SInce his band of sycophants left him at the process moment when the loneliness and sobriety struck, he took the crossing of that those moments to be he ancient and pre- selected reality. Yes, it was then that he decided to form an unholy alliance with the Philosoraptor, whose services could be purchased for a price. 

He picked up his divice, a thin palladium encased phone with a sensor that when you passed the  correct hand over it it spawned a two d  visual of the being you were speaking to. 

Given that the being was Yumanity, who lived above the treelike and communicated via alpha wave , it was wise of him to stick with two d. The third d would enable even a smaller version of him would undoubtedly destroy the carpet in the boardroom. 
(Break and intro Rando and  the Ice queen?) 
***********************************
Even the 2D Yumanity was a bit disturbing. Several jeweled horns stuck out at angles that made no sense for a more symmetrical being. His lazy eye and his hard working one competed for space on a face that looked creepy crawly con trolly at best, the emergence of the death. 


“You rang, oh deep pocketed one? “ Yumanity drawled in his best imitation of deep south .

“Why yes, ahem errr- I  have a job for you” 

“Will you ever just invite me to tea? “ 
JMQ was startled by this plaint- he took it more seriously than it was worth. 

“Oh er em - I didn’t know you liked tea “

Yumanity threw his head back and laughed heartily at JMQ’ expense. 

“Tea with the likes of you is perhaps not the best thing to do- but perhaps not the worst”

He suddenly appeared in the boardroom albeit in a slightly smaller form than usual . At 1/3 his general size he was still enormous. 

“WHere is my lapsing souhng? 
JMQ struck a bell with a gong- a small man wearing a suit of mail entered, bearing a silver salver with the implements of tea upon it. After depositing it on the boardroom table it moonwalked out, showing no other signs that it had noted the beast that took up 3/4 of the room. While it was hard to get good help these days, it was easy when you paid triple for it. 

“Let me guess- you want to kill all and sundry again. It seems to be what you try to do every year. “

“I feel it is time to kill history and replace it with memory” 

Yumanity threw back his head and laughed- “That is easy- I already did it for you….”

JMQ shook his head- “She is back, the Ice Queen. She is trying to drag the Reality Kings back in - you know what will happen then, 

Yumanity sighed, disgusted. 

“You've done it this time haven't you?”

JMQ sniffed. His verbal acuity should not be challenged by this yeti monster, this arrogant beast of will. 


"I suppose you had a better idea, just murdeing history willy nilly, yet not truly finishing the job and leaving her to roam unfettered?" 


Yumanity was disgusted with the truth of this matter- So he doubled down and sent small puffs of smoke out of his antlers and through his nose. Noisome did not even begin to cover it. The boardroom now was covered with a low level smoke cloud that outdid sulfur and a post world series dumpster for stench. 



He laughed a bit " What ever shall we do? Destroying the past seems like a thing that should be relatively easy- the question is which parts of it are we going to decimate? Shall we scrunch it into small bits like spitballs? Shall we eat it live and whole , still wriggling from the tank? Shall we just feed it to the pike that lives at the mouth of the Willamette? "

JMQ walked the geometric pattern of the rug- one foot in front of the other, he concentrated on seeing it so hard that it dissolved at the end of his nose. 

I suppose if we are to murder the past we should choose a specific part- that seems to be a bit easier than

	Role in Story:fter ­Charles Darwin published his revolutionary "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, scientists scrambled to find fossilevidence of extinct human ancestors. They sought these so-called "missing links" to fill in the gaps on the timeline of human evolution. When archaeologist Charles Dawson unearthed what he thought was a missing link in 1910, what he really found was one of the biggest hoaxes in history.
The discovery was the Piltdown man, pieces of a skull and jaw with molars located in the Piltdown quarry in Sussex, England. Dawson brought his discovery to prominent paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward, who touted its authenticity to his dying day.
Although the discovery gained world renown, the lie behind Piltdown man slowly and steadily unraveled. In the ensuing decades, other major discoveries suggested Piltdown man didn't fit in the story of human evolution. By the 1950s, tests revealed that the skull was only 600 years old and the jaw came from an orangutan. Some knowledgeable person apparently manipulated these pieces, including filing down and staining the teeth.
The scientific world had been duped. So who was behind the fraud? Many suspects have surfaced, including Dawson himself. Today, most signs point to Martin A. C. Hinton, a museum volunteer at the time of the discovery. A trunk bearing his initials contained bones that were stained in exactly the same way the Piltdown fossils were. Perhaps he was out to embarrass his boss, Arthur Smith Woodward, who refused to give him a weekly salary.

She knew all history - all of it lived inner aura. It was made of 7 thhings- 8 if you count the indifference of man to fact. Fact was one of those things that could be bent by pure sightless reasoning - or more importantly on the ability of the world to use eye dominance to determine what they saw. After all, one eye squinted in could tell you what it was and how it could be.

*******************************************************************************************


He sat on the underramp support beam with his long legs tucked under his  chin. Watching the cars go by he meditated on the possible stories and narratives that each metal box contained. They were on a street that led to a bridge onramp, but not one of the major ones.


So the cars that went by were not the ones that were shiny, or wanted to be noticed. They were just the ones that knew the sneaky way to get there. They were also the ones that had something to hide.

Martin knew that sitting there watching the cars go by was not going to solve his problem. Then again, perhaps he could help it along.

Extracting the snub nosed Saturday night special from the back of his jeans, he single eye squinted down the street. The first one wasn’t anything doing- minivan filled with Mom and kids. The only thing that would get him off on that one would be the begging before the shooting. so no, not them. Not today.

Because that was what it was- a way to get off. The rest of the time he was a Business Analyst for a corporation that had it’s headquarters about 5 blocks away from here. Every day, they gave him more work to do and every day he did more and more and more.


Every day he thought he wouldn’t be able to do more. His ritual of shaving with a straight razor in front of the steam fogged mirror was a few moments where the world that he hated and needed and that would one day kill him did not own him fully.



This had been the truth of the matter for the last 30 years of work and would be even more of it for the next 10. 10 more, that was all he needed until he could retire. He and his wife could sit on the back porch and have the kitties purr on their laps. Unless of course they were dead by that time.

That was how he marked time now- he looked at every being that had any animation in his path and imagined them dead. Drained of all soul juice. Done.

Still, in between the seconds where he desperately and all consumingly wanted to die to STOP IT ALL- he contemplated it like it was a gilded idol and he was a Hittite of old.


The crow would lose it’s feathers. The woman who sat behind the front counter at the coffee shop  would just have her eyes plucked out - perhaps leaving one of them to loll out of the socket, laying gently on her rouged and powdered cheek.Her body would not realize anythign was wrong, and it would stay exactly where it always was, ready to dispense the coffee into the greek printed cups.  


This thought cheered him immensely , and there as a spring in his step as he wandered down the street towards the ElleCorp.

Black Dog Syndrome. No matter how sweet-natured the animal, people see the dark coat and are hesitant to adopt the pet

Another series that made extensive use of hammerspace was Kodomo no Omocha, where the mother of the main character would pull toy hammers of varying sizes to tap her daughter on the head to forge breaks in her ranting and offer a chance to glean understanding and wisdom.
Hammerspace in games[edit]
The theory of Hammerspace can also be applied to many video games, as game mechanics often defy those of the real world: for instance, a character might be able to carry a sword larger than himself without any sign of it before use, and inventory capabilities are commonly implausible

Getting past the past was going to be tricky. In all his 1000 years he had never done something for someone else that did not eventually either directly or indirectly benefit him. The past on this particular thing was going to make him less viable, less easy in his mind. 

But she had been so good to him, finding teh cracks in his armor and making it fly when it normally would just send him to the bottom of the barrel. 

Her help in thwarting the air whale, the sacrifices she made to make the against Ellenbogen and Yumanity- all at great personal cost to herself- that was a moment that he ruminated on0 a time investment that was something taht he hoped and schemed that 


Replace time with something else. 

That was it- the rub, the hammer, the duvine deau ex machina that would shatter the sorrow of death that time wrought. It was also going to rease those memories of joy, the time spent in her arms, the love they shared. What was going to happen after that, he did not know.

A similar fate befell jarl Hákon Sigurðarson in 10th century Norway; according to Snorri Sturluson, after his death, "So great was the enmity of the Throndhjem people against Earl Hakon, that no man could venture to call him by any other name than "the evil earl"; and he was so called long after those days."[8]</Text>

sentence with two spaces, but in these days of word processors
this is now less common.) A 12-point font such as Courier,
Times New Roman or Arial should be used throughout. In
Scrivener, however, you can write using any font and
formatting you choose - the "Formatting" pane of the Compile
sheet can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the "Novel" project template, the Compile
settings will deal with changing the font and formatting to
those required for standard manuscript format.
     Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be

approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header
comprising the author's real surname, the title of the work
(or a key word from the title) in capitals, and the page
number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled in the "Page
Settings" pane of the Compile sheet.
                               #
     Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do
not simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by
the typesetter. The "Separators" pane of Scrivener's Compile
sheet can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document.
     Indicate italics by underlining. In Scrivener, you can
use italics and set them to be converted to underlines upon
export or print by using "Convert italics to underlines in the
"Transformations" pane of the Compile sheet.

                     Chapter Folder Title
     Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the Compile settings.
The "Separators" pane of the Compile sheet can be set to start
a new page for each chapter folder, and the "Formatting" pane
can be used to add page padding at the top of the new page and
insert the chapter number (the latter using the "Level
Settings"). All of this has already been done for you in the
"Novel" project template.
     Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number
of words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will
happily accept a word processor word count these days. In
Surname / TITLE / 5
Scrivener, you can insert a word count of your manuscript by
using Edit > Insert > Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you
may wish to have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in
which case select Edit > Insert > Draft Word Count > Rounded
To Nearest 100--this feature is used on the title page of this
manuscript, in fact). Note that the actual word count will not
be inserted, but a tag that will be substituted for the word
count upon export. In reality, the formatting of a manuscript
is often only really crucial when submitting directly to a
publisher--first time novelists will usually submit to an
agent first, and agents are often less picky about format and
will point you in the right direction before submitting your
work to a publisher.

Ben smiled. His head was perfectly round, and the brows that hunched obver his  green eyes were even more expressive than he thought . 

“I thought that freezing to death was a nice way to go?”

I glared at him, wondering what the hell he was on about. It might have been because the cavern around us had dropped to a steamy 30. 

He was looking up at the grates that covered the apex of the cavern. The water around us seemed poisoned and filled with effluent- by my lights it had to come to the sewage treatment plant that sat on the edge of the UGB. It was out there because people didn’t want shit in their backyards. The people who lived outside of the UGB had chosed to walk away from the ease and comfort of the city- they fought back the night with coops filled with fowl and tried to grow things that they could eat. 

This didn’t work as well as it used to, without any kind of restrictions on what corporations could do the land had become so hostile it seemed to resent the intervention of well meaning but eventually futile efforst to make it productive. The city lived better- it learned to eat smog and relish the taste of the ersazt versions of what came before.

“Can we focus on what we came here to do? “

Ben shrugged, tossing the ice axe up with one hand and then snatching it out of the air with the other. 

“As the lady wishes.....”

We had left the orange chanters far behind, as they had gotten into a discussion on who was supposed to attack us and been so involved in that we just walked away. 

They stood on either side of the bridge of politicians. It stretched across the top of the collider abyss, braided slippery of false promises, endless bullshit and self interest. PAC money molded it together, and the faces of the lie mongers were turned out . Unless they were a christian, in which they leaned into it with their most tender parts - they were the ones who enjoyed pain, but did not own that fact.

            <Text>Rando and the Ice Queen 

I have no history, she said. None whatever. There is no long thin line of remembrance and regret that ties me to the earth.

He leaned back against the tombstone n the garden of death. It was a cemetery situated at the top of Skyline, looking over the city. The rolling hills sloped sharply off to one side, giving the dearly departed a cinematic view of the bridges and houses that lay beneath the fog blanket,  like  the legs of the duck, serene on top and whirling madly underneath

The girl wasn’t really a girl- she was one of those  beings  with lines that mapped every place she had been at the corners of her mouth and eyes, the two things that got the most use. She was lovely nonetheless, her silver-gray hair slipping gently into the crook of her collarbone as if suggesting that his hand may trail after, feeling the skin that had not seen summers and the hair that was spun like the silk of spiders. 

Rando wanted very much to kiss her. He felt that might give her something to remember, even if it was only surprise and shock that such a man would take a liberty. 

“How do you tie your shoes or get to the bottom of the ocean? “

She meditated on that question, cocking her head with a look of general anesthesia just shaken off. “I have not needed to tie my shoes in a while as she pushed her feet out from under her flowing peacock gown. They were long and thin and white, consistent with the rest of her. The thing that was a bit surprising were the prehensile toes, shaped with icicle nails that sparkled in the weak reflection of sun that broke through the grey fog that lay uncorking and disinterested at the feat of the garden. 

They wiggled at him, momentarily distracting him from his purpose in finding out what this being wanted of him.  

His blonde grey  curls caught the light that always sat on death’s garden. He came up here every so often to commune with nature, outside the Urban Growth Boundary- the UGB was a both a prison and a protection, a spot where the world both started and ended at the horizon. 

This place did not grow death- it maintained it, keeping souls gently.


The pickpocketeers gravestone was where he come, to mourn his fallen colleagues . Manju, Jerome and Isolde lay not under these solid marble statues, but in the belly of an air whale , It had eaten them during a particularly wild jousting party that was held underneath the bridge where Rando lived, the air Whales 



He reached out a hand to touch her - his hands were  filled with interesting callouses and smart fingers. She sighed as though he had already stroked her.



History, she said. That word has a lot of things  it means he said. 

“Well”- she used the moss of the gravestone of M.Bartlett, 1867-1902 to cushion her back as she sat up and looked him in the eye- “history is one of those things that is written and re-written -

and if you are going to change history of course it would be to suit yourself .....you'd be foolish to do otherwise” 

“Hmph” he said. 
“Hmph “ she said back, face smiling and one eyebrow raised. 


Once that long thin line has been broken there is little to say. Or perhaps that is when things actually start getting interesting. 


He thought about telling her more- but she grabbed his hair and kissed him. It seared. It left him breathless within breaths. There was a  mark involved. 

His arms pulled her in, and hers pulled back.

            <Text>The penny farthing had been tough- stolen from a TGIFridays that was in a strip mall somewhere outside the UGB, 

The audax was of 200 km weight

firefighter bicicycle 

boda boda

The type  of bike they stole made for the reasons behind the interactions-- it was liking looking into windows to steal their cycles. The angle of the tire, the geometry of the frame- that informed you about what kind of being they were. The bikes with inordinately long flatboards on their backs were for those who would spawn and stick their children to the boafrd, papoosed like indians of old 


The young, the old, the agile, the small the weak, the old black men in the middle of the night spouting their low rent jesus bullshit, telling you how they too would save the earth of the earsof the world would  bit stop and listen to them.If you knew, if you could just listen to them tap tap tap on teh vaulat of the sky king- then they would be allowed into the gentle gates of heaven instead of driving a lawn mower bike that dragged it’s blades against the macadam, seeking purchase on ghost grass that was and wwould eventually be but at the moment was no where to be found. 


The Audax was the most nimble of bikes- it did not want to be caught. It had a delicate dancing tip to it- it reared back on it’s hind tire, fenders flaring to avoid the asphalt curse of gravity sought . 






Rando had been an engineer in another life- brought inside the UGB after the Belgian Waffle Wars of 2330 no one knew who birthed him. </Text>

            <Title>The pickpocketeere</Title>
            <Text>Plays of the ancient Greek theatre always included a chorus that offered a variety of background and summary information to help the audience follow the performance. They commented on themes, and, as August Wilhelm Schlegel proposed in the early 19th century to subsequent controversy, demonstrated how the audience might react to the drama.[3] In many of these plays, the chorus expressed to the audience what the main characters could not say, such as their hidden fears or secrets. The chorus often provided other characters with the insight they needed.[citation needed]




Th e philosoraptor- a being that lives undereath the mounatin and spoyt poetic and noetic discsuuions on teh meaning of life. he is the arch nemesis of Rando the bike theifand they have been playing cat and mouse and air while for many many years. It gets to a point whenre ellenbogen is trying to take over the whole place and they need to join forces to rescue the world 

The philo already has an origin story 

the snowman (yeti) will be his servanct and double 


Are the pickpocketeers- they are three guys who were crushed bt one ov the ellen bogen trucks and they are ghosts of homies- this enables them to move their way through things and beat up old people without really being too bad a fella 



artin uses them as a shield against his terrible corporate captores (or they foil his attempt to kill things by pushing him around )





e himself is one of those guys who js a total ahole bbut doesn't know hit- he doesn't know how or why he is this wau, he kjust is after having eveyrthing handed to him all his life he doesn't understand that the world is a mean and ugly place, His first bounds with fear and the final recognition that other peipke are indeed people is one of the highlights of the story arc 

“ i don’t beleive in love, or anything that looks like love. It all pretty much boils down to who’s taking advantage of who that week. 

Rando pontificated as he stood on the corner, surrounded by his trolly compadres. They sat on a block that was owned by the Ellenbogen Corporation.

It was dominated by the pink mirrored building that held 760 stories of ice cubed hell, all of them individually boxed and wrapped.

 At one point in the history of the town no one was supposed to extend the UGB to encompass the sky- but the Ellecorp as it was affectionately known put a stop to that by turning all their contractors to milliners and haberdashers. Under the ancient laws as long as there was the making of hats, there could be any height of building. Plus, as there had not been the ability to make an almost three mile high building back then, no one thought to say no. 

“I was an orphan before there were my parents! I was a king of the sewers before the holes were dug- I am the emperor of all that will or ever will be. 


His coterie stared at him with widened eyes- he was indeed the King of The Rats, Shaman of the sidewalks, magnate of the pickpocketeers as they were known. Their con was all about finding people who were deep inside their devices, incoherently tapping away to unseen people. the things that they found in their pockets were of an epic and interesting combinations. At times they pulled a hand out with fingers full of fish hooks, but only when the fishing boats bulging with sea sturgeon  came into town.

Otherwise this was a somewhat comprehensive list- they pulled out scarves and jingly coins and fingers and a dildo stil aviibrating, wallets ,phones ,a bag of  magic mushrooms, a pocket full of dirt, a gold nugget a small pony, 7 lords a leaping and 12 ladies dancing, a monster made of wood shavings and spit that danced the tango with all comers, a foundling, a lostling, a theory of relativity and  the occasional beast of burden.Sometimes when they went into a particularly deep pocket there was Jimmy Hoffa, or at least his ghost. Bright as day he would glower at them, and have to be shoved back into the pocket for the self preservation of all involved. 



They stopd there at the threshold of the corporate world hoping to catch a glimpse of the man behind the mask. JMQ the Zth would occasionally appear on the balcony, Juan Peron style , hoping to see a mass of adoring fans below. 

Rando and his crew were hoping to figure out what exactly this guy was doing. The people around them were becoming less and less sensible. This was illustrated by the fact that they did not look both ways, they ate food that was terrible for them and they asked for things that did not exist.

            <Title>Yumanity</Title>
            <Text>


Yumanity stood with his back to the moon. He was 25 feet high and 75 wide- not fast, but solid. He had taken his hands and wrapped them around neck of the ice queen, and slowly pulled them together. It broke her neck but not her spirit. It was that which had called to all of the night creatures to avenge her - her frost babies slid down from the top of the mountain on their bellies- teeth bared, they could smell yumanity’s blood warming the snow round him, causing the steam to rise and obscure him. 


Yumanity wasn’t a moral quandary- he was spat from between the legs of the purple coffin ghost and then sent out to the world to engage and enrage the child of man. He teased the sentient by being a no-see-um- there but not there- alive but not of this earth. 

In the wrestling match for the powers of the world- he was the referee.

Yumanity lived above the treeling  in a cabin made of the bones of stars. Fallen from the sky he had collected them over the millenia, slowly stacking them higher and higher, allowing the forest detritus to fill in the spaces between. Inside those spaces he used the grout of age and decay, the stubborn tooth decay of the ass of the long ears, the tears of reindeer sailing over the tundra 



 He had a small window made of their bones, their hair plaited into red and blonde curtains that let in some light . When he awoke each day he greeted the sun with a roar, a maw so big and deep that he had accidentally swallowed the sun on several occasions- this is what made the area around the mountain so dark.The sun was no dummy. He would keep it in his belly for a time, because even Yumanity became cold is left out there too long. It would rise heat from his chest, allowing his ears and his face to burn a lovely shade of burnt siennna touched with orange. 


After he tired of eating fire he would spit it out again- that was why the moon waxed and waned on this corner of the world . The sun would come out his eyes and jewelled horns, reflecting all that was or could be. He was the true arbiter of the time and space continuum.  

But he was one to play both ends against the middle. The Ice Queen had been his lover, which was why he killed her to begin with. There is no love that does not shatter the object, the subject and the predicate.

He and the Ice Queen had loved with all the capacity of the otherworldly- trees had fallen and made new pieces of the landscape- bent doubles the rivers had changed courses over the arguments with the mountains about where the stream of the glacier should go. 

Their faces or hands chance meeting in the silence of the thunderless summer storms would rend the  earth, causing chasms wide and angry to open and swallow all for 5 miles on either side. It was that, that feeling that death would finally claim him that caused him to claim her life. Sending her to Hephastues to toil in the heats of hell was a delaying tactic at best. He  would be avenged upon n at some point, when he was not watching, when he had another lover to share his bed. 

The ice queen loved him because his fire matched her own- and she too was indifferent to the lies of the human. They were lesser, not of the world that she existed in, not of use in any way.

            <Title>The Leidenfrost effect</Title>
            <Text>Check leidenfrost and the touch 
Alive 



What you're looking at is a unique demonstration of the ever-fascinating Leidenfrost effect. Named after 18th Century German doctor Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost, the phenomenon occurs when liquid comes into contact with a surface that is much, much hotter than the liquid's boiling point. Under such conditions, an insulating layer of vapor is created between the droplet and the surface. In the case of a water on, say, a piping hot frying pan, the water droplet can actually float on the layer of vapor. This not only causes the droplet to hover, it also protects the water from boiling outright.

  
The leidenfrost effect had had a great influence on Rando's machinery. When he went to build the common sense machine, he knew that it would not be anything that would come easily. After all, the idea of common sense was that it married all of the senses into the ability to judge. Most people went around ignorning at least one of the senses on any given day. The leidenfrost effect was one of making water do things that it didn't normalllt do. It sent things sideward and upwards and backwards when the expectationw as that it would indeed go forwards . It would eventualy, but it needed to go different places before it did. The leidenfirst was what pwered the whole thingumabob, enabling it to continue forward even though it semed that the commonstes of senses was very uncommon after all.  



Smell was an unpopular one, for a variety of reasons There are many more unpleasant scenst in the world than there are pleasnat ones. The stench of the death flower, the reek of hot garbage, the burning ammonia of piss, these were all more prevalatent than the heavy silk of jasmine, or the daisy dance of cut grass, or the watery juices that confused the sense of smelll with taste of grilling meats.  People tended to disbeleive in smell because it was less painful than having to proces sit. The scent of a Nana's house, the paste and paper that had no life in it- those were the murderers of that sense. 





Touch was the one that everyone beleibed in, but no one should.  The description of how something feels could be as much of a lie as anyhintg- it would be dizzied up by the emotive qualities- what would happen if you touched it and it burned? Would the hopping aroud teh room cursing and screaming make it better or worse, like the moment when the eye doctor would flip the lenses on you? No one really knew exactly which ones were better- it was all leading questions and haearsay.



Once you tasted soemething, and it was embedded in that timespace- that was when it became a full sense. Divorced from the initial context of the thing- it no longer echoed or rang in precisely the same way. Or even if it was the same place, with the same clicking plates or sound of a mariachi band,  it may not have the mouthfeel of the goooey chocolate milk or toffee that had been just warmed to a place where it teased the tip of the tongue with salt and sugar and left the mouth hungry for more. This was used to start the machine, as it was a long piece of leather made from 700 bicycle seats that had been carefully unravelled from their tightened strings - to start the machine you needed to chew a piece of teh leather off at the start, and spit it out into a spitoon created for just that purpose. The softended leeather would travel down the spiralling  twists that had been twisted into endless innner circles , since commons sense needed to turn back onitslef to check for it's keys of course. 





And seeing things- don't get me started on seeing things! The shape, the color, the angel and the angle- no one could claim the definiition of anything, despite all photographic and sense memorry in the worl. Havin these things touch each otehr made for a request and a desire- but no two eyes, be they fly or human or meerkat or belgian waffle ever got the samme view of anything. the fct that you could indeed talk to people about the diffeences was the only things that saved that sense from being a complete waste of time. That and it gave you a reason to wear sunglasses. The sight portion of the grand machine was made of all the reflective peices off the bikes that Rando had stolen- glittery faceted rednesses, the blinky threelights that told people of your departure, the powdercoat made of the elements of useenium and referendium - those things created a brillaiance of sight that sheared right to the heart of whatever matter it happened to be. 







 Hearing- oh the sweet joyof hearing- the melodius cacophaony of the sound of the world!!! Sucking down the punk rock, the duck quack, the dance of the sugar plum fairies on top of the pin with 10 thousand other angels - these were the things worth listening foro. The crucnh of the elk on snow that had no other feet on it- the  sound of the tire to the pavement, the babies cry, the sounds of love between lovers who knew each other's body so well taht the least shiver caused the most joy- oh hearing was the one that most beleived, and was the one that he used to strap it all in. The hearning part of the machine was made of great ear trumpets, harvested from the coffin factory. Teh coffin factory had offered a model that allowed the dealy departed to keep a lone to the upper word when it was buried. It was made of beautiful pieces of bent wood, polished to a high laquered shine that would bounce the words of the world back to the dead. For the dead do still hear- it is just a more far off thing than the things one hears as a live person. LIve people are concerned with the sounds of life- the dead are concerned with teh sound of the world- teh whole world is so very very loud, taht even staying up late to the world will not dismiss all the small sounds that dimisnish and take away from the ability to hear even in the darkest of nights





The flickery stars ate the night, and tehy slid down the hill to get to the machine The young lovers saw it, but did not know what to make of it. After all, since they were yound the commonest of senses was denied them.....

It was dominated by the pink mirrored building that held 760 stories of ice cubed hell, all of them individually boxed and wrapped.

 At one point in the history of the town no one was supposed to extend the UGB to encompass the sky- but the Ellecorp as it was affectionately known put a stop to that by turning all their contractors to milliners and haberdashers. Under the ancient laws as long as there was the making of hats, there could be any height of building. Plus, as there had not been the ability to make an almost three mile high building back then, no one thought to say no. 

“I was an orphan before there were my parents! I was a king of the sewers before the holes were dug- I am the emperor of all that will or ever will be. 


His coterie stared at him with widened eyes- he was indeed the King of The Rats, Shaman of the sidewalks, magnate of the pickpocketeers as they were known. Their con was all about finding people who were deep inside their devices, incoherently tapping away to unseen people. the things that they found in their pockets were of an epic and interesting combinations. At times they pulled a hand out with fingers full of fish hooks, but only when the fishing boats bulging with sea sturgeon  came into town.

Otherwise this was a somewhat comprehensive list- they pulled out scarves and jingly coins and fingers and a dildo stil aviibrating, wallets ,phones ,a bag of  magic mushrooms, a pocket full of dirt, a gold nugget a small pony, 7 lords a leaping and 12 ladies dancing, a monster made of wood shavings and spit that danced the tango with all comers, a foundling, a lostling, a theory of relativity and  the occasional beast of burden.Sometimes when they went into a particularly deep pocket there was Jimmy Hoffa, or at least his ghost. Bright as day he would glower at them, and have to be shoved back into the pocket for the self preservation of all involved. 



They stopd there at the threshold of the corporate world hoping to catch a glimpse of the man behind the mask. JMQ the Zth would occasionally appear on the balcony, Juan Peron style , hoping to see a mass of adoring fans below. 

They looked up and saw the mural of Yumanity. Yumanity was the spokesmonster for Badvice. Badvice was being marketed as the “answer to all your problems”

Manju scoffed “Look at that guy- he thinks he’s all that. 

Isolde was equally unimpressed. She had problems that no one knew about, and there wasn’t going to be an 

Rando and his crew were hoping to figure out what exactly this guy was doing. The people around them were becoming less and less sensible. This was illustrated by the fact that they did not look both ways, they ate food that was terrible for them and they asked for things that did not exist.

            <Text>there is a huge difference between history and memory, altho those two things are enough alike that there are times when they could be mistaken for one anothe rin a dark alley. History is the distillation of events bot real and imagined, both told and heard, the black , the white and the grey. The romans knew that a prson's worth was less than nothing when they had no history - the (insert latin thingy here) caused the person to be reased, tto no longer exist where the world lived. In essence, there was no one anymore after they pisssed off the roman senate. While these things can be seen by the



Being alive leaves a mark or two. Being suddenly separated from that state leaves it as well. The philosoaptior knew this, and spent a large amount of time being ever so bored with the  




The philosoraptor was stationed at the beginning of teh cave mouth where the Sense and Sensibility machine lived. She had been under the mountainfor those 346 years, but she and Rando went back even furthr tahn that. There was more to Rando than met the eye. 





He seemed to be about 45, but somehow had packed several lives into that time, stacked here and there, carefully packed in one way or the other. Like a wall that had been made of stream tumbled stones, all the tiles were not necessarily uniform, but they did neatly fit together. 





He and teh Philosoraptor had met in a temple in  The Autralian Outback. While Phil was eating random worshipers  for sport  (she would discreetly spit them back  out the back door after a harrowing journey down the esophogus) Rando wandered in from the square of light taht split the darkness.    His silouhette was suitably dramatic with insincere lines and it blocked the reality of the place from view. 

Describe them as coming out and stupid. 



He sat at her feet while she stood on stage on her back legs, smoking and smiling like a cheshire cat gone wrong. The game in the temple was for the supplicant to enter on their knees, trying to make it to her with a question she deemed worthy. Since it was somewhere in the medieaval times, the only parishioners were dark as a moonless night, and they held her in regard enough to only send their best and brightets. She had been in house god all over theworld at this point- after the locals got used to her tricks of eating people and then spitting them out, she no longer was worshipped, and would have to move on. 



Rando sauntered to the circular tiled dais that sat in front of the altar where she reclined, sending out intricate smoke rigs from first one nostril than the other. He hitced up his saggy pants and crossed his eyes . She took this as a challenge. 



"What do you request of me? "



"Only the truth of the matter, as you see fit"



Her snort took out a couple of the temple attendants. They ran off to where the  pool used for baptism was, a deep stone cooled square that put out their blood orange robes. 



"That is a very subjective thing now isn't it"



"nothing can be "very" subjective- it either is or it isn't"



Hmm- you are smarter than you look- you may remain. What is it that you want?



He took his time thinking about his response. While he had been wandering aeound Australia (before it was australia, it was named Belefesque ) he was hinking about why. And how. And what else. And really? And about 1000 other questions ,such as "Just the tip? " "Why you so nasty?" "Why, does this make me look fat? " "Are you serious?" "If you really cared - you would know what I was asking!" And on and on- no one ever runs otu of these mundanities, they are what life was made of . So they sat for several years, trading questions back and forth. The eating of the various scribes and wise people kep the converstations lively 



Finally it was time for Rando to go- to move forward to the next place as he had always done. He rose, shook teh Philosoraptors hand and stated "We shall meet again" and exited just as he had entered- with empty hands and a full mind. 



She forgot him instantly , and went on to eat other supplicanst as though nothing had happened before or since 



Afetr the end of the Belefesquivians with the advent of the intro of the flying machine, she wandered for another 300 years, studying with the holy men in Tibet, the charlatans in Rio, the monsters of rock in Afghanistan, the mosques and temples of the world opening themselves to her with a flick of shiny scaled wings. She would swoop in and learn all there was to be learned, make it better and then swoop back out again. Eventually she became exhausted, and tucked herself into the aforementioned ditch for a quick snooze. The snooze lasted 346 years and several other sunteranean lifetimes. She awoke with just as many questions as ever, no closer to the answers but refreshed and ready to start eating villagers again. 



Rando had fared just as well- his two wheeled invention that made man skim the earth instead of be attached to it was taken all over the wordl . Holland and England and Scotland , Egypt and Africa- all these places needed to match wheels after the first one was created and they all looked at it with dumb eyes asking , quite sensible, what the heck is that hting for? 



The bicicyle revolutionazed the way people got to places- it made the units of measure less about days and more about hours. Peopel would try to pack many more people and things onto thei thne made sense, ut eventually the towering [uyramid of luvestock, humans and hard c=food s would ensure that the bike was the perfect way to get from here to to there without burngn dinosaurs or trees. Rando becae the precurse, the idea guym the one that showed up in wet pants and a string bikini to tell the wordl that the other place, over that mounting was a way ot get to where you wante dto be without it being a huffy misuert  So many intretrpattions of the bike!! Those that were one person powered were strong, bbut the ones that were multiperson powered were even stronger. It was the spark that mad e the thinking-- one small one would light the world afire. 



Rando was that guy- moving and grooving and continuing foreward All that came after was because f what came before, but no one would know now would they> Click click clikc when the cards in the spokes woulf go round the hub- more and more and ore

once- just once mind you. Not twice or three times. Just the once. At this time. And at no other. 
 
There was a bike thief named Rando

He stole all that was precious to the heart of man. 

He slept under the overpass, beating his weathered gaze all the way up the concrete turrets  iit every night  by the headlights of those on their way to things he had no experience with.

Watching those who wandered round him like endless small ants- unloved and untested , they ran in ugly circles, wishing for some sign that any of this was worth it.

He proved to them they did care by using the cover of night over his long greyed head 
to take their chariots


Easily tho- he gentled the locks and finessed the frame. Confident as a courtesan,
his strong, gnarled hands touched their love , stealing the known away with fingers so ligth they flew. 


Nimbly, they left the safe house of the in love and hurried off into the night, tucked between his oaken thighs that plowed through the clouds of steamy fog that enveloped the city. 

He reached his tent, tucked under the overpass. Neatly squared it held all he needed. This bike was so light he could heft it in with one hand. After putting it in the back he looked about for his own safety. 

Honor was not among thieves anymore

            <Title>Work</Title>
            <Text>Rando had decided that the work of building the common sense machine was to be done in several phases. The outline of intellect was such that it needed organization and time to ensure that it would indeed become a machine that had use, would do what it said it was going to do and the ability to move the minds of the people back to being intellectually capable. 

After all, the minds of the world had already been organized and re organized by the 


Rando had decided on the common sense machine when Isolde and Manju went to the great house in the sky. He was hoping that teaching people to avoid air whales and pay attention when Yumanity stomped down fron the moubtain would actually be useful on some level. 

He had fallen into the cavern from the Garden of Death. Sitting on the tombstone of the pickpocketeers, he leaned back on it. Suddenly the grave dropped out from under him, and he sstarted sliding down a tunnel- it was packed earth and rocks, and as he bumped and ground on circular tube, he used all of the impressive swearwords at his command. All of a sudden it ended, after seeming to go on for days and months- the lack of ligth can do that to anyone. 


The end was as stunning as birth must be- being in a confined space and then suddently free- there was about 100 feet of drop that happened at the end, and he finished his downward descent with a plash, a splash and a kerflump into a lake that was 30 feet deep. The biophosphorescence lit the water from below - he was a little compuzzled by the sudden upside down, but oddly, the water was salty. He popped up with the ingrown bounceback that he came with- a moment where he was weightless caused him to bob around, his feet up and his head down. Once he figured which way was up he looked around in awe. 


The Cavern was 100 feet tall, the room stdded with stalacticites of purple and green and orange. The faint light reached into most of the corners, but left a few dark. His natural affinity for creatures of the night allowed him to sense the bats sleeping in the corners, their snoring gently rocking the air in the cavern. 

He was in awe- and this was where he was supposed to be </Text>

            <Text>What is my narrators ultimate goal and how does that get there. 

The narrators ultimate goal is to put common sense into the people of the Town of Port. He does this by way of the Sense and Sensibility machine. However, the Port Towners  have been sucked into being stupid by J ellenbogen- who wants them to be stupid so that he can take advantage of them. He sates them with bread, circuses(the philipino twins come from the circus) and religion ( which Yumanity is the god- he’s very much the guy who scares them into being Good and Buying Whatever.) 
The sacrament is badvice- a thing that they are being fed at brunch as a supposedly organic sweetener made from the husks  
He has been slowly teaching him the lessons by stealing their bikes, and is in the process of building the machine to take back the city from J ellenbogen , who wants to do the exact opposite . The Ice Queen is sent to distract him from thijs, and she almost gets her way, then she falls for him and decides to join his side. 


Ben and Leah, the young lovers are the catalysts for this- they have been noticing more and more that the world around them is not quite right. They are the kind of people who Do Right. 

(Conversation about this between the two of them -she notices that the people are becoming more and more ridiculous- he agrees with her and they start to look more closely at the world around them)
