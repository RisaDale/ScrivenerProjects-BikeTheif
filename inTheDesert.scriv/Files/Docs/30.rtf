\f0\fs22 \cf0 Driving out today from the airport with Two felt like  being released. The mexican desert was a surprise- he thought of desert and pictured shimmering heat and rocks and dust. Maybe an iguanaThe road to Saltillo had everything you saw in the US- same chain restaurants., same truck stops . Two drowsed in the seat next to him, his TFL cap hiding the top of his face. It produced a strange affect in him, almost like he'd been driving this road forever before and would never stop. Time got bendy- it always did when he was travelling 9 days in a row. The procession of hotel rooms and airplane lounges lulled him tho- heliked that it was always temproary, that conversations could be had with no recrimination, no need to remember what you were saying vecause it would slide off the corps colosum like snail ooze. }
